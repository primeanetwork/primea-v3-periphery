As of now, no contracts from `@primea/v3-core` or `@primea/v3-periphery` have been deployed to production (mainnet) environments.

The following table contains **placeholder addresses** for internal testing and documentation purposes only. Final addresses will be published via the official Primea Network channels following governance approval and third-party audit signoff.
